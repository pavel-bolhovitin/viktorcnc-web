## Project Architecture

**Stack**: React + Next.js (App Router) + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS. Deployed as static site to AWS S3.

**Rendering**: SSG only. All pages use `generateStaticParams` / `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` where needed. No SSR, no server actions that require a running server. Output: `next export` (`output: 'export'` in `next.config`).

**Hosting**: S3 static website hosting (+ CloudFront CDN). No Node.js server at runtime. API routes forbidden — they won't run.

**UI components**: shadcn/ui (Radix primitives + Tailwind). Add components via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`, never hand-roll what shadcn provides. Always check `src/components/ui/` for an existing component before writing a custom one — use what's already there.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes only. No CSS modules, no styled-components.

**Key constraints**:

- No dynamic routes that aren't statically pre-rendered at build time.
- No `useSearchParams` without a Suspense boundary (Next.js static export requirement).
- Images: use `next/image` from `next-export-optimize-images` (drop-in replacement that optimizes images at build time for static export). Import from `next-export-optimize-images`, not `next/image`.

## [RULES GROUP] Nextjs Rules

This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## [RULES GROUP] React Rules

### [RULE] Naming Conventions

**@when**: always

**@description**: Consistent naming across the codebase.

- **Components** (`.tsx` files containing a React component): PascalCase. `HeroSection.tsx`, `CopyButton.tsx` — correct. `heroSection.tsx`, `copy-button.tsx` — forbidden.

### [RULE] Use Existing UI Components First

**@when**: always, before writing any interactive or styled element

**@description**: Always check `src/components/ui/` before building a custom element. shadcn/ui components cover buttons, toggles, dialogs, inputs, carousels, etc. Hand-rolling duplicates what's already there and drifts from design system tokens.

- **Check first**: look in `src/components/ui/` before creating any new interactive element.
- **Customize via className**: pass Tailwind overrides via `className` — `cn` uses `tailwind-merge` so conflicts resolve correctly.
- **Add missing**: if a needed component is absent, add it via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`, don't hand-roll.

### [RULE] No Blank Lines Between Imports

**@when**: `*.ts`, `*.tsx`

**@description**: All import statements must be contiguous — no blank lines between them. Import order is handled by the linter; blank lines are not needed and will trigger lint errors.

### [RULE] No Section Label Comments in JSX

**@when**: *.tsx

**@description**: Do not add `{/* Label */}` comments that merely name the block below them (e.g. `{/* Header */}`, `{/* Quality Control */}`, `{/* CTA */}`). Well-named elements and structure make these redundant. Only add a JSX comment when explaining a non-obvious constraint or workaround.
